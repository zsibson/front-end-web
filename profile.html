        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          Hi I'm Zac! I'm a student developer at Devmountain for Full Stack Development. I grew up in American Fork, Utah but I've lived in Missoula, Montana for six years now. I love camping, backpacking and exploring wildnerness areas. I'm learning to code so I can change my career, have a family and be a generous person!

              <td>
                There's so many places I want to visit, but not very many I'd chose to live for a year. I would have to say North Carolina, I've always been drawn to that state.

              <td>
                I would definitely go back in time, probably Greco-Roman Era. There's so many interesting events that have happened I think we can learn from them for the future.

                Probably this computer that I'm using right now. I decided to invest in a good one to start my coding journey off right.
